# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

### Peer-based

#### Purpose
The purpose of a peer-based or p2p network is to allow users to connect with each other directly. By having multiple pc's that connect through this method it eliminates the need for a dedicated server. Using this method allows each pc to function as a client as well as a server.

#### Benefits
The main benefit of a peer based network is that there is no single provider being responsible for a server. Each computer stores files and acts as a server. Each computer has its own equal responsibility for providing data. In the peer-to-peer model, many users on the network could store a file. Each computer can then send sections of the file, sharing the workload. Each client can download and share files with other users. A p2p would not be an ideal network if a company was looking to provide a service like selling tickets as one main server would need to keep track of how many tickets are left. Also on P2P networks, no single computer is responsible for storing a file - anyone can delete files as they wish meaning that it is certainly not ideal for commercial use.

#### resource implications
With a peer to peer network the only resources are the computers and the cables that connect them. This means that the primary cost is going to go towards the pc's themselves. The cables may cost a little but in comparison to the systems they are relatively cheap.

#### working practice
Peer-based networks are fairly easy to set up and understand. within this model any computer can be used and connected to another through a hub or switch. The hub or switch will only be there to connect the pc's together. This allows all the computers to communicated without the need for special hardware or software. This method also allows the network to be easily maintained internally as there is no need for an external network manager. 

Due to the design of this method, it does have some drawbacks. Each computer has a greater load using this method as they are all doing not only their tasks but they are also taking on the tasks that a server would have. Each computer will also need to have its own antivirus and protection software as there isn’t a server in place to stop unwanted traffic. If a virus was to gain access or get onto one machine, then it can easily gain access to the others on the network.

### Client-server
#### purpose
The purpose of a client server is to serve the end users. These end users are called clients. The clients would use this server method in order to gain access to resources like files, songs, videos or many other services that can be stored on a system known as a server. 
#### benefits
The main benefits of a client-server network are; All the files are stored in a central location which can be accessed by all pc’s on that network. All of the network peripherals are controlled centrally. This method means that back-ups and security for the network is all controlled from a central location. Users are able to access shared files and data from a central location(the server).
#### resource implications
Resource implication is fairly simple as files and data are stored in a central location on a server. All the pc’s on that network are able to access them as long as the users on those pc’s have been given permissions too. This means that the main cost of this network is going to go towards the central server. The cost of the server wont be too expensive as the primary function is only to store data and provide a connection to the internet and other application services. The pc's themselves all depend on what there use is going to be for. For instance, a games developer is going to need a much higher-spec pc in comparrison to an accountant. 
#### communications
Pc’s on this network method will send requests to the central server and it will respond by fulfilling a request. For example, an end user or client may ask to open a public document or file which is stored on the server, the server will then respond by checking the end users credentials to make sure they have the right ones to access that file. Once that process is finished it will then open up the file for the user on that system. As clients connect with the server through the internet, the client’s internet speeds will determine how quickly the file or resource is downloaded to their system/pc.
#### working practice
This method is one of the most common for working practices. The reason for this is so that clients are able to access files and information that is required for their job but need to be shared and available for multiple people. This method includes internet so one of the more common ways that this is used would be for colleges or university’s where the students need to access files or lectures.
#### commercial opportunity
This method can be used for commercial use as companies could allow clients or users to access specific files or data from outside the business. A lot of commerce companies use this network method as it means that a lot of people can access the same piece of data at one time, this is something that is very important for a business which deals with sales.
#### information sharing
Information sharing is a fairly simple process through this method as this method allows users to receive and send data to the server through the internet. This means that if the server has been set up correctly users can upload information and files for others to use and see. This method also allows users to make what they upload private or public.


### Cloud

#### purpose
The main purpose for a cloud network method is for business, companies or anyone really if they want to have an external server which can be maintained by an external source. This means that this method is usually over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis. This method allows users to access the same applications and resources that an internal server would have but this way they can access it all over the internet whether it is internally or externally.
#### benefits
Some benefits for cloud computing are; flexibility, cloud-based services allow businesses to easily scale up their capacity if needed. There is also the ability to scale down also. Another benefit is disaster recovery; this method allows smaller businesses to have an affordable alternative in case of a disaster. Another major benefit is the increased collaboration. Teams of people are able to access, edit and share files anytime and anywhere allowing for a greater workflow.
#### resource implications
Cloud computing is possibly one of the best methods to help with resource implications. As mentioned above, one of the main benefits of this method is the ability to scale up and down easily. With cloud computing a business or company might pay monthly to have access to the network. This means that if they want it to be upscaled they may need to either help pay for that upscale or pay extra a month. 
#### communications
This method allows users to access, edit and share files and data anywhere anytime so therefore if the company has implemented an application which can allow users to communicate then users and clients would be able to communicate as long as they have internet access. Communication would not only be between two users, it will also be between the client and the cloud server. The client would send a request to the server and it would respond, whether it is to gain access to a file or to connect with another client through that server. 
#### working practice
By companies using cloud computing it allow employees to be more flexible with their working practices. For example, you have the ability to access data and files from anywhere, anytime. The only real constraint to this method is the need for an internet connection. If you need to access your files or data whilst out of the office, you can very quickly open a virtual office and start working.
#### information sharing
Using cloud computing, it allows users to be able to access, edit and share data and files quickly and easily. This means that users are able to share information a lot easier and a lot more efficiently than before. A user can simply upload a file or use a communication application to connect with another user or client. This method helps many people connect as well as provide opportunity for multi user functionality for projects and other means.
#### collaboration
Collaboration through cloud computing gives a business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of traditional methods. If you are working on a project across different locations, you could use cloud computing to give employees, contractors and third parties access to the same files and data.

### Cluster

#### purpose
The purpose of a computer cluster is for multiple computers to be viewed as a single system connect through fast local area networks. A computer cluster is a set off loosely or tightly connected computers that work together to be seen as a single computer. Clusters are usually used to help improve performance and availability over that of a single computer.
#### benefits
Clusters are primarily designed with performance in mind however some other factors also play a part too. The main benefits of clusters are; Fault tolerance – The ability to continue working when a node has malfunctioned. Scalability, clusters can easily be upscaled or even downscaled if required when it meets the users needs. 
#### resource implications
Cluster servers can be set up and designed in many ways. Some ways which help with resource management could be a business using a cluster to help balance web-services. This would be done by allocating specific queries to individual nodes so that the overall response time would be optimized. Another alternate way in which a cluster could be designed is to design a high-performance cluster where the main use is for scientific calculations, some people may also refer to this method as “supercomputing”. The different ways that this network can be set up can change and affect the cost massively. If the client only wants the cluster for simple web balancing then it wont need to be as large as a cluster for supercomputing which can end up being very expensive due to the large number of nodes needed.
#### working practice
The working practice for a computer cluster depends on the needs of the user or business. For example, a company may want to set up a cluster in order to help load balance their site. The company may also be a research company or even vehicle crash investigation company, this would mean that they may set up the cluster to help with computational simulations in which the computer would generate high level simulations and calculations for the business at a faster rate than if they just used a single system.
#### commercial opportunity
With computer clusters there are many commercial opportunities for businesses. For example, a company may be all about investigating road accidents. This would mean that they could use their cluster to simulate these accidents to help investigators or even help with cases. An alternate to this could be for web balancing. A company may want to sell the use of their cluster to help host a website, the cluster would then help balance the queries on the site as well as manage specific queries to specific nodes if required.

### Centralised

#### purpose
Centralised computing’s purpose is to allow the basic client pc’s connected to the main central server basic functions. The main computation and processes are dealt with within that central server.  The central server is deployed with primary application, huge computing resources, storage and other high-end computing intensive features. The client pc’s connect to the server will then have a visual display, basic input devices and a thin CPU with network capabilities. All of the client pc’s are dependant on the central server for any application access, computing, storage, internet access and security. This also means that the administrator in the centralised computing infrastructure manages all of the client nodes from the central server interface.
#### benefits
The benefits of a centralised network are; Reduction of cost, as the network will solely rely on the central server to do all of the work, it means that you can save when increasing the number of client pc’s as they do not need to be high-spec. Higher data security as all requests and transmissions go through the central server. Processing will be consistent over all pc’s and therefore there wont be one pc that is better than another.
#### resource implications
The cost of a centralised network all depends on a few things. 1. How many client pc’s does the business require. 2. What sort of computational processes are the business planning on doing with the server and 3. How many client pc’s do you expect to be utilising the central server at one time. Like all other server networks it all depends on what it is needed for which will determine how expensive the central server is going to be.
#### communications
Communication through a centralised server is very straight forward. All requests and data is sent directly to the central server where it will then distribute the data to the other pc’s. As nothing is connected to the internet, no data will leave the network through the pc’s unless they are taken off the network and uploaded.
#### working practice
A centralised network would be used within a business to manage files and data from a central server location, this means that everyone would need to be connected to this central server to access them. If a lot of people are all using the server then it may reduce the efficency of the server. A centralised network will also allow for faster transfer of data between people meaning that the effiecency of work will increase.

### Virtualised

#### purpose
The purpose of a virtualised network is to combine the available network resources by splitting up the bandwidth into channels. Each individual channel is independent from the others and can be assigned to a server or a device in real time. This process means that all users will have access to the resources from the network from one computer. Virtualised networks are virtual. This means that nothing is actual physical.
#### benefits
The benefits of a virtualised network are; It is cheaper as it does not actually require any physical hardware to be installed or used. You can now just purchase the license or the access from a third-party provider and start working as if the hardware was installed locally. Energy saving is also a major benefit of a virtualised network as it allows for companies to save energy but not actually needing the local hardware.
#### resource implications
The cost to set up a virtualised server is a lot less than other alternatives as with a virtualised server you would not be running physical hardware. You can also save money by allocating the space where you would set up a normal client server and use that space for something else. Also it means that updates and software can automatically be installed by the provider, this means it saves time for IT professionals so that they can focus on other tasks.
#### working practice
A virtualised network can be implemented into a work place for many different reasons. You could implement the virtualisation in order to test new networking hardware or software. There is also the ability to use it for training so that they are not actually handling physical hardware and if they make a mistake it can be easily resolved.
#### commercial opportunity
Network virtualisation has a lot of positive features that will bring businesses to want to use them. A main reason is the use of virtual hardware and software as appose to physical hardware. This means that the business will have to invest less as they won’t need to purchase the physical hardware, however they will need to pay for the services to get the virtualisation set up as well as regular maintenance and updates.

### OSI Model
1.	Application – This layer is very similar to the TCP/IP model layer with the same name. This layer is where different protocols are assigned to the different types of data.
2.	Presentation – This layer is where the data is compressed or encrypted. This layer also helps to make the data easier to interpret as well as easier to determine the type of data that it is.
3.	Session – This layer is responsible for obtaining connections between different applications. Either TCP or UDP is used depending on the requirements. This is similar to the transport layer of the TCP/IP model.
4.	 Transport – This layer is responsible for the transmission of the data. This layer also checks for errors in the data whilst its being received and sent.
5.	Network – This layer also helps with the transmission of data however its main purpose is to get the destination address. This information is then applied to the data, so it can be sent correctly.
6.	Data Link – This layer is responsible for the encryption of the data before it is sent to the recipient. This layer also decrypts data back into readable packets for the other layers to process.
7.	Physical – This last layer is the one that is responsible for the physical links that help to transmit the data. The information can be transmitted by electrical pulse or even light pulses.
### TCP/IP Model
1.	Application – This layer is responsible for the assignment of which protocol is used by each application or data.
2.	Transport – The transport layer is responsible for creating and maintaining the communication between the sender and the receiver. There are only two protocols which are used in this layer. TCP which checks to make sure that the receiver has received the data and UDP which does not check to see if the receiver has received the data.
3.	Internet – This layer is responsible for organising the data into packets. The packets will then be sent to the organised recipient using their IP address.
4.	Network access – This layer is responsible for interfacing with your networks architecture. This layer also checks for any errors with the data that has been sent or received.
## Working standards and protocols:
### IEEE 802.3
IEEE 802.3 is known as the standard for ethernet. The standard specifies the physical media and the working characteristics of the ethernet. The standard also specifies the media that supports the standard, which are coaxial of both 185 and 500 meters, optic fibre, twisted pair telephone and multi-channel coaxial with a maximum length of 3,600 meters. As only ethernet signals are carried on medium, the ethernet is designated ‘BASE’, meaning baseband signalling and designated 10base as the standard refers to the transmission speed of 10Mbps.
### IEEE 802.7
IEEE 802.7 Identifies the recommended broadband LAN practices. The design, instillation and the test parameters for broadband cable technologies within the network are specified within this standard. 
### IEEE 802.8
IEEE 802.8 is used as the standard in token passing computer networks for fibre optic in a LAN. This standard was created by the fibre optic technical advisory group. It gives recommendation for the configuration and testing of fibre optic LAN and metropolitan area networks.
### IEEE 802.11
IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards which are set out for defining communication in a wireless LAN. These standards are primarily a set of guidelines for implementing Wi-Fi. The standard itself is made up of many amendments, some of which are .11a, .11b, .11g as well as .11n which states the different frequency bands used.
