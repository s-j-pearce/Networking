# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

### Peer-based
The purpose of a peer-based or p2p network is to allow users to connect with each other directly. The main benefit of a peer based network is that there is no single provider being responsible for a server. Each computer stores files and acts as a server. Each computer has its own equal responsibility for providing data. In the peer-to-peer model, many users on the network could store a file. Each computer can then send sections of the file, sharing the workload. Each client can download and share files with other users. A p2p would not be an ideal network if a company was looking to provide a service like selling tickets as one main server would need to keep track of how many tickets are left. Also on P2P networks, no single computer is responsible for storing a file - anyone can delete files as they wish meaning that it is certainly not ideal for commercial use.
