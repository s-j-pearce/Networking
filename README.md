# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

### Peer-based

#### Purpose
The purpose of a peer-based or p2p network is to allow users to connect with each other directly. By having multiple pc's that connect through this method it eliminates the need for a dedicated server. Using this method allows each pc to function as a client as well as a server.

#### Benefits
The main benefit of a peer based network is that there is no single provider being responsible for a server. Each computer stores files and acts as a server. Each computer has its own equal responsibility for providing data. In the peer-to-peer model, many users on the network could store a file. Each computer can then send sections of the file, sharing the workload. Each client can download and share files with other users. A p2p would not be an ideal network if a company was looking to provide a service like selling tickets as one main server would need to keep track of how many tickets are left. Also on P2P networks, no single computer is responsible for storing a file - anyone can delete files as they wish meaning that it is certainly not ideal for commercial use.

#### working practice
Peer-based networks are fairly easy to set up and understand. within this model any computer can be used and connected to another through a hub or switch. The hub or switch will only be there to connect the pc's together. This allows all the computers to communicated without the need for special hardware or software. This method also allows the network to be easily maintained internally as there is no need for an external network manager. 

Due to the design of this method, it does have some drawbacks. Each computer has a greater load using this method as they are all doing not only their tasks but they are also taking on the tasks that a server would have. Each computer will also need to have its own antivirus and protection software as there isn’t a server in place to stop unwanted traffic. If a virus was to gain access or get onto one machine, then it can easily gain access to the others on the network.

### Client-server
#### purpose
The purpose of a client server is to serve the end users. These end users are called clients. The clients would use this server method in order to gain access to resources like files, songs, videos or many other services that can be stored on a system known as a server. 
#### benefits
The main benefits of a client-server network are; All the files are stored in a central location which can be accessed by all pc’s on that network. All of the network peripherals are controlled centrally. This method means that back-ups and security for the network is all controlled from a central location. Users are able to access shared files and data from a central location(the server).
#### resource implications
Resource implication is fairly simple as files and data are stored in a central location on a server. All the pc’s on that network are able to access them as long as the users on those pc’s have been given permissions too. Data and files being stored from the central location means that it is quicker for users to access them and use them. The only real constraint of this method could be internet connection, e.g. if someone has low internet speeds, they may have to wait longer for a file that someone who has fast internet speeds. 
#### communications
Pc’s on this network method will send requests to the central server and it will respond by fulfilling a request. For example, an end user or client may ask to open a public document or file which is stored on the server, the server will then respond by checking the end users credentials to make sure they have the right ones to access that file. Once that process is finished it will then open up the file for the user on that system. As clients connect with the server through the internet, the client’s internet speeds will determine how quickly the file or resource is downloaded to their system/pc.
#### working practice
This method is one of the most common for working practices. The reason for this is so that clients are able to access files and information that is required for their job but need to be shared and available for multiple people. This method includes internet so one of the more common ways that this is used would be for colleges or university’s where the students need to access files or lectures.
#### commercial opportunity
This method can be used for commercial use as companies could allow clients or users to access specific files or data from outside the business. A lot of commerce companies use this network method as it means that a lot of people can access the same piece of data at one time, this is something that is very important for a business which deals with sales.
#### information sharing
Information sharing is a fairly simple process through this method as this method allows users to receive and send data to the server through the internet. This means that if the server has been set up correctly users can upload information and files for others to use and see. This method also allows users to make what they upload private or public.


### Cloud

#### purpose
The main purpose for a cloud network method is for business, companies or anyone really if they want to have an external server which can be maintained by an external source. This means that this method is usually over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis. This method allows users to access the same applications and resources that an internal server would have but this way they can access it all over the internet whether it is internally or externally.
#### benefits
Some benefits for cloud computing are; flexibility, cloud-based services allow businesses to easily scale up their capacity if needed. There is also the ability to scale down also. Another benefit is disaster recovery; this method allows smaller businesses to have an affordable alternative in case of a disaster. Another major benefit is the increased collaboration. Teams of people are able to access, edit and share files anytime and anywhere allowing for a greater workflow.
#### resource implications
Cloud computing is possibly one of the best methods to help with resource implications. As mentioned above, one of the main benefits of this method is the ability to access, edit and share files anywhere anytime. This means that as long as a user has an internet connection and the correct credentials then they can access data fast and easily. This method’s only constraint in this area would be internet connection, the user may or may not be in an area with ideal internet access, meaning it may take longer for users to gain access to larger files.
#### communications
This method allows users to access, edit and share files and data anywhere anytime so therefore if the company has implemented an application which can allow users to communicate then users and clients would be able to communicate as long as they have internet access. Communication would not only be between two users, it will also be between the client and the cloud server. The client would send a request to the server and it would respond, whether it is to gain access to a file or to connect with another client through that server. 
#### working practice
By companies using cloud computing it allow employees to be more flexible with their working practices. For example, you have the ability to access data and files from anywhere, anytime. The only real constraint to this method is the need for an internet connection. If you need to access your files or data whilst out of the office, you can very quickly open a virtual office and start working.
#### information sharing
Using cloud computing, it allows users to be able to access, edit and share data and files quickly and easily. This means that users are able to share information a lot easier and a lot more efficiently than before. A user can simply upload a file or use a communication application to connect with another user or client. This method helps many people connect as well as provide opportunity for multi user functionality for projects and other means.
#### collaboration
Collaboration through cloud computing gives a business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of traditional methods. If you are working on a project across different locations, you could use cloud computing to give employees, contractors and third parties access to the same files and data.

### Cluster

#### purpose
The purpose of a computer cluster is for multiple computers to be viewed as a single system connect through fast local area networks. A computer cluster is a set off loosely or tightly connected computers that work together to be seen as a single computer. Clusters are usually used to help improve performance and availability over that of a single computer.
#### benefits
Clusters are primarily designed with performance in mind however some other factors also play a part too. The main benefits of clusters are; Fault tolerance – The ability to continue working when a node has malfunctioned. Scalability, clusters can easily be upscaled or even downscaled if required when it meets the users needs. 
#### resource implications
Cluster servers can be set up and designed in many ways. Some ways which help with resource management could be a business using a cluster to help balance web-services. This would be done by allocating specific queries to individual nodes so that the overall response time would be optimized. Another alternate way in which a cluster could be designed is to design a high-performance cluster where the main use is for scientific calculations, some people may also refer to this method as “supercomputing”.
#### working practice
The working practice for a computer cluster depends on the needs of the user or business. For example, a company may want to set up a cluster in order to help load balance their site. The company may also be a research company or even vehicle crash investigation company, this would mean that they may set up the cluster to help with computational simulations in which the computer would generate high level simulations and calculations for the business at a faster rate than if they just used a single system.
#### commercial opportunity
With computer clusters there are many commercial opportunities for businesses. For example, a company may be all about investigating road accidents. This would mean that they could use their cluster to simulate these accidents to help investigators or even help with cases. An alternate to this could be for web balancing. A company may want to sell the use of their cluster to help host a website, the cluster would then help balance the queries on the site as well as manage specific queries to specific nodes if required.
