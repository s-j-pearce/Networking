# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

### Peer-based

#### Purpose
The purpose of a peer-based or p2p network is to allow users to connect with each other directly. By having multiple pc's that connect through this method it eliminates the need for a dedicated server. Using this method allows each pc to function as a client as well as a server.

#### Benefits
The main benefit of a peer based network is that there is no single provider being responsible for a server. Each computer stores files and acts as a server. Each computer has its own equal responsibility for providing data. In the peer-to-peer model, many users on the network could store a file. Each computer can then send sections of the file, sharing the workload. Each client can download and share files with other users. A p2p would not be an ideal network if a company was looking to provide a service like selling tickets as one main server would need to keep track of how many tickets are left. Also on P2P networks, no single computer is responsible for storing a file - anyone can delete files as they wish meaning that it is certainly not ideal for commercial use.

#### resource implications
With a peer to peer network the only resources are the computers and the cables that connect them. This means that the primary cost is going to go towards the pc's themselves. The cables may cost a little but in comparison to the systems they are relatively cheap.

#### working practice
Peer-based networks are fairly easy to set up and understand. within this model any computer can be used and connected to another through a hub or switch. The hub or switch will only be there to connect the pc's together. This allows all the computers to communicated without the need for special hardware or software. This method also allows the network to be easily maintained internally as there is no need for an external network manager. 

Due to the design of this method, it does have some drawbacks. Each computer has a greater load using this method as they are all doing not only their tasks but they are also taking on the tasks that a server would have. Each computer will also need to have its own antivirus and protection software as there isn’t a server in place to stop unwanted traffic. If a virus was to gain access or get onto one machine, then it can easily gain access to the others on the network.

### Client-server
#### purpose
The purpose of a client server is to serve the end users. These end users are called clients. The clients would use this server method in order to gain access to resources like files, songs, videos or many other services that can be stored on a system known as a server. 
#### benefits
The main benefits of a client-server network are; All the files are stored in a central location which can be accessed by all pc’s on that network. All of the network peripherals are controlled centrally. This method means that back-ups and security for the network is all controlled from a central location. Users are able to access shared files and data from a central location(the server).
#### resource implications
Resource implication is fairly simple as files and data are stored in a central location on a server. All the pc’s on that network are able to access them as long as the users on those pc’s have been given permissions too. This means that the main cost of this network is going to go towards the central server. The cost of the server wont be too expensive as the primary function is only to store data and provide a connection to the internet and other application services. The pc's themselves all depend on what there use is going to be for. For instance, a games developer is going to need a much higher-spec pc in comparrison to an accountant. 
#### communications
Pc’s on this network method will send requests to the central server and it will respond by fulfilling a request. For example, an end user or client may ask to open a public document or file which is stored on the server, the server will then respond by checking the end users credentials to make sure they have the right ones to access that file. Once that process is finished it will then open up the file for the user on that system. As clients connect with the server through the internet, the client’s internet speeds will determine how quickly the file or resource is downloaded to their system/pc.
#### working practice
This method is one of the most common for working practices. The reason for this is so that clients are able to access files and information that is required for their job but need to be shared and available for multiple people. This method includes internet so one of the more common ways that this is used would be for colleges or university’s where the students need to access files or lectures.
#### commercial opportunity
This method can be used for commercial use as companies could allow clients or users to access specific files or data from outside the business. A lot of commerce companies use this network method as it means that a lot of people can access the same piece of data at one time, this is something that is very important for a business which deals with sales.
#### information sharing
Information sharing is a fairly simple process through this method as this method allows users to receive and send data to the server through the internet. This means that if the server has been set up correctly users can upload information and files for others to use and see. This method also allows users to make what they upload private or public.


### Cloud

#### purpose
The main purpose for a cloud network method is for business, companies or anyone really if they want to have an external server which can be maintained by an external source. This means that this method is usually over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis. This method allows users to access the same applications and resources that an internal server would have but this way they can access it all over the internet whether it is internally or externally.
#### benefits
Some benefits for cloud computing are; flexibility, cloud-based services allow businesses to easily scale up their capacity if needed. There is also the ability to scale down also. Another benefit is disaster recovery; this method allows smaller businesses to have an affordable alternative in case of a disaster. Another major benefit is the increased collaboration. Teams of people are able to access, edit and share files anytime and anywhere allowing for a greater workflow.
#### resource implications
Cloud computing is possibly one of the best methods to help with resource implications. As mentioned above, one of the main benefits of this method is the ability to scale up and down easily. With cloud computing a business or company might pay monthly to have access to the network. This means that if they want it to be upscaled they may need to either help pay for that upscale or pay extra a month. 
#### communications
This method allows users to access, edit and share files and data anywhere anytime so therefore if the company has implemented an application which can allow users to communicate then users and clients would be able to communicate as long as they have internet access. Communication would not only be between two users, it will also be between the client and the cloud server. The client would send a request to the server and it would respond, whether it is to gain access to a file or to connect with another client through that server. 
#### working practice
By companies using cloud computing it allow employees to be more flexible with their working practices. For example, you have the ability to access data and files from anywhere, anytime. The only real constraint to this method is the need for an internet connection. If you need to access your files or data whilst out of the office, you can very quickly open a virtual office and start working.
#### information sharing
Using cloud computing, it allows users to be able to access, edit and share data and files quickly and easily. This means that users are able to share information a lot easier and a lot more efficiently than before. A user can simply upload a file or use a communication application to connect with another user or client. This method helps many people connect as well as provide opportunity for multi user functionality for projects and other means.
#### collaboration
Collaboration through cloud computing gives a business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of traditional methods. If you are working on a project across different locations, you could use cloud computing to give employees, contractors and third parties access to the same files and data.

### Cluster

#### purpose
The purpose of a computer cluster is for multiple computers to be viewed as a single system connect through fast local area networks. A computer cluster is a set off loosely or tightly connected computers that work together to be seen as a single computer. Clusters are usually used to help improve performance and availability over that of a single computer.
#### benefits
Clusters are primarily designed with performance in mind however some other factors also play a part too. The main benefits of clusters are; Fault tolerance – The ability to continue working when a node has malfunctioned. Scalability, clusters can easily be upscaled or even downscaled if required when it meets the users needs. 
#### resource implications
Cluster servers can be set up and designed in many ways. Some ways which help with resource management could be a business using a cluster to help balance web-services. This would be done by allocating specific queries to individual nodes so that the overall response time would be optimized. Another alternate way in which a cluster could be designed is to design a high-performance cluster where the main use is for scientific calculations, some people may also refer to this method as “supercomputing”. The different ways that this network can be set up can change and affect the cost massively. If the client only wants the cluster for simple web balancing then it wont need to be as large as a cluster for supercomputing which can end up being very expensive due to the large number of nodes needed.
#### working practice
The working practice for a computer cluster depends on the needs of the user or business. For example, a company may want to set up a cluster in order to help load balance their site. The company may also be a research company or even vehicle crash investigation company, this would mean that they may set up the cluster to help with computational simulations in which the computer would generate high level simulations and calculations for the business at a faster rate than if they just used a single system.
#### commercial opportunity
With computer clusters there are many commercial opportunities for businesses. For example, a company may be all about investigating road accidents. This would mean that they could use their cluster to simulate these accidents to help investigators or even help with cases. An alternate to this could be for web balancing. A company may want to sell the use of their cluster to help host a website, the cluster would then help balance the queries on the site as well as manage specific queries to specific nodes if required.

### Centralised

#### purpose
Centralised computing’s purpose is to allow the basic client pc’s connected to the main central server basic functions. The main computation and processes are dealt with within that central server.  The central server is deployed with primary application, huge computing resources, storage and other high-end computing intensive features. The client pc’s connect to the server will then have a visual display, basic input devices and a thin CPU with network capabilities. All of the client pc’s are dependant on the central server for any application access, computing, storage, internet access and security. This also means that the administrator in the centralised computing infrastructure manages all of the client nodes from the central server interface.
#### benefits
The benefits of a centralised network are; Reduction of cost, as the network will solely rely on the central server to do all of the work, it means that you can save when increasing the number of client pc’s as they do not need to be high-spec. Higher data security as all requests and transmissions go through the central server. Processing will be consistent over all pc’s and therefore there wont be one pc that is better than another.
#### resource implications
The cost of a centralised network all depends on a few things. 1. How many client pc’s does the business require. 2. What sort of computational processes are the business planning on doing with the server and 3. How many client pc’s do you expect to be utilising the central server at one time. Like all other server networks it all depends on what it is needed for which will determine how expensive the central server is going to be.
#### communications
Communication through a centralised server is very straight forward. All requests and data is sent directly to the central server where it will then distribute the data to the other pc’s. As nothing is connected to the internet, no data will leave the network through the pc’s unless they are taken off the network and uploaded.
#### working practice
A centralised network would be used within a business to manage files and data from a central server location, this means that everyone would need to be connected to this central server to access them. If a lot of people are all using the server then it may reduce the efficency of the server. A centralised network will also allow for faster transfer of data between people meaning that the effiecency of work will increase.

### Virtualised

#### purpose
The purpose of a virtualised network is to combine the available network resources by splitting up the bandwidth into channels. Each individual channel is independent from the others and can be assigned to a server or a device in real time. This process means that all users will have access to the resources from the network from one computer. Virtualised networks are virtual. This means that nothing is actual physical.
#### benefits
The benefits of a virtualised network are; It is cheaper as it does not actually require any physical hardware to be installed or used. You can now just purchase the license or the access from a third-party provider and start working as if the hardware was installed locally. Energy saving is also a major benefit of a virtualised network as it allows for companies to save energy but not actually needing the local hardware.
#### resource implications
The cost to set up a virtualised server is a lot less than other alternatives as with a virtualised server you would not be running physical hardware. You can also save money by allocating the space where you would set up a normal client server and use that space for something else. Also it means that updates and software can automatically be installed by the provider, this means it saves time for IT professionals so that they can focus on other tasks.
#### working practice
A virtualised network can be implemented into a work place for many different reasons. You could implement the virtualisation in order to test new networking hardware or software. There is also the ability to use it for training so that they are not actually handling physical hardware and if they make a mistake it can be easily resolved.
#### commercial opportunity
Network virtualisation has a lot of positive features that will bring businesses to want to use them. A main reason is the use of virtual hardware and software as appose to physical hardware. This means that the business will have to invest less as they won’t need to purchase the physical hardware, however they will need to pay for the services to get the virtualisation set up as well as regular maintenance and updates.

## Conceptual models:
![osi vs tcp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/40356588-69ec4976-5db1-11e8-9a71-74711b51c8f6.png)
### OSI Model
1.	Application – This layer is very similar to the TCP/IP model layer with the same name. This layer is where different protocols are assigned to the different types of data.
2.	Presentation – This layer is where the data is compressed or encrypted. This layer also helps to make the data easier to interpret as well as easier to determine the type of data that it is.
3.	Session – This layer is responsible for obtaining connections between different applications. Either TCP or UDP is used depending on the requirements. This is similar to the transport layer of the TCP/IP model.
4.	 Transport – This layer is responsible for the transmission of the data. This layer also checks for errors in the data whilst its being received and sent.
5.	Network – This layer also helps with the transmission of data however its main purpose is to get the destination address. This information is then applied to the data, so it can be sent correctly.
6.	Data Link – This layer is responsible for the encryption of the data before it is sent to the recipient. This layer also decrypts data back into readable packets for the other layers to process.
7.	Physical – This last layer is the one that is responsible for the physical links that help to transmit the data. The information can be transmitted by electrical pulse or even light pulses.
### TCP/IP Model
1.	Application – This layer is responsible for the assignment of which protocol is used by each application or data.
2.	Transport – The transport layer is responsible for creating and maintaining the communication between the sender and the receiver. There are only two protocols which are used in this layer. TCP which checks to make sure that the receiver has received the data and UDP which does not check to see if the receiver has received the data.
3.	Internet – This layer is responsible for organising the data into packets. The packets will then be sent to the organised recipient using their IP address.
4.	Network access – This layer is responsible for interfacing with your networks architecture. This layer also checks for any errors with the data that has been sent or received.
## Working standards and protocols:
### IEEE 802.3
IEEE 802.3 is known as the standard for ethernet. The standard specifies the physical media and the working characteristics of the ethernet. The standard also specifies the media that supports the standard, which are coaxial of both 185 and 500 meters, optic fibre, twisted pair telephone and multi-channel coaxial with a maximum length of 3,600 meters. As only ethernet signals are carried on medium, the ethernet is designated ‘BASE’, meaning baseband signalling and designated 10base as the standard refers to the transmission speed of 10Mbps.
### IEEE 802.7
IEEE 802.7 Identifies the recommended broadband LAN practices. The design, instillation and the test parameters for broadband cable technologies within the network are specified within this standard. 
### IEEE 802.8
IEEE 802.8 is used as the standard in token passing computer networks for fibre optic in a LAN. This standard was created by the fibre optic technical advisory group. It gives recommendation for the configuration and testing of fibre optic LAN and metropolitan area networks.
### IEEE 802.11
IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards which are set out for defining communication in a wireless LAN. These standards are primarily a set of guidelines for implementing Wi-Fi. The standard itself is made up of many amendments, some of which are .11a, .11b, .11g as well as .11n which states the different frequency bands used. 

### Routed protocols
A routed protocol is how routers communicate with one another. The routers will exchange information that will enable them to select specific routes on that network. These routes will help provide the best router for that information. This method only works when both routers know the network that they are trying to send the information through. The most popular type of routing protocol is IP addresses. Routed protocols are the reason that IP addresses are more popular than other less conventional routing protocols.
#### IPv4
IPv4 stands for Internet protocol version 4. This protocol was one of the core protocols that standard-based interworking methods on the internet. IPv4 was originally thought to have enough addresses however due to the increase in population and active users it was starting to run out of addresses to assign. A solution to this problem was IPv6. IPv4 only had 4 billion possible addresses.
#### IPv6
IPv6 stands for Internet protocol version 6. This protocol was introduced in order to fulfil the address requirements. This was the sixth version to be created. This protocol is in place due to the number of addresses that needed to be assigned. The principle of IPv6 is the same as IPv4 however the number of possible addresses were drastically increased from 4 billion to over 340 undecillion (2^128). 
#### Global unicast
Global unicast is a feature in IPv6 which allows for a convenient, publicly routable to be used on the internet or any public domain that uses a single node. The main problem with global unicast is that when the data packets are sent they are not actually sent to one target destination. They are actually sent across the network to all hosts which for obvious reasons can cause major security risks.
#### Multicast 
Multicast addresses are logical identifiers for a group of hosts in a computer network that are available to process frames intended to be multicast for a designated network service.
#### Link local 
A link-local address is an IPv6 unicast address that can be automatically configured on any interface using the link-local prefix and the interface identifier in the modified EUI-64 format.
#### Unique local 
A Unique Local Address (ULA) is an address that is used in IPv6 as an identifier, the problem with a ULA is that data is not supposed to be routed outside of the specified range and the address is not allocated by an address registry.
#### EUI 64 
The Extended unique identifier (EUI) is a format which allows a host to automatically assign itself a unique 64-bit IPv6 interface identifier without the need for manual configuration or DHCP. This is a benefit of IPv6's over IPv4 is the capability for automatic interface addressing.
#### Auto configuration
Auto-configuration is another important feature offered by the IPv6 protocol. Auto configuration allowed the automatic configuration of devices without manual intervention, in the form of a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server which holds pre-set IP's in a pool and changes each time.

## Services and network applications:
### FTP
FTP stands for file transfer protocol. It is used for the transfer of computer files and data between a client and a sever on a network.
### HTTP
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. This protocol is used on the world wide web and it defines how messages are formatted and transmitted across the internet.
### SMTP
SMTP stands for simple mail transfer protocol. This protocol is used for the email transmissions. Emails are sent over the internet using SMTP to be able to send from one server to another.
### POP3
POP3 stands for post office protocol 3. This protocol is designed to receive emails. POP3 works side by side with SMTP to complete the transfer of an email to reach another client on another server.
### SSL
SSL stands for secure sockets layer. This protocol is responsible for security over internet communications by using specific cryptographic methods such as encryption.

## The impact of networking topology, communication and bandwidth:
### Topologies:
#### Logical:
A logical topology is a set of fragments that define the specific arrangement and communication of nodes on a network. The topology of a network can easily be maintained and reconfigured by the topology. The topology itself will handle how signals and how the data passes through the network as well as how it is handled on the devices within the network.
##### Ethernet:
Ethernet is a type of logical topology. Ethernet is the most common LAN technology. Ethernet formats exactly how data is going to be transmitted to other network devices on the same network.
##### Token Ring:
A token ring is a LAN in which computers are connected in a ring or star topology and pass one or more logical tokens from host to host. Only the host who holds the token can send data. One the data has been received and confirmed then the token is released to the next host.
#### Physical:
A physical topology is the physical hardware of a network. This can consist of the clients and the cables on the network connecting them. This allows organisations to physically layout the network. By doing this you can determine the cable to be used and how it will be run through the building.
Some types of physical topologies are:
##### Star:
The star topology is when all devices and clients are connected to one central node. This node would mainly be a type of hub or switch.
##### Ring:
The ring topology is when all the clients and devices are connected to one another in a circular layout. Each device is joined to two others and the data packets would travel around these nodes until it reaches its destination.
##### Bus:
A bus topology is when all of the clients and devices are connected on a single line which is terminated on both ends. 
##### Mesh:
A mesh topology is where there are multiple connections between different machines on the network which allows for different routes to be used if one is unusable.
##### Tree:
A tree topology is a combination of a star network topology and a bus topology. In a tree topology, nodes of the underlying bus network topology are replaced with a complete star topology.
### Communication:
Communication in networking is where two or more machines send and receive data to one another. Usually the most common form of communication is from a pc requesting data from a server. Requesting data from a server can range from a number of simple tasks. For instance a user may be trying to access their emails or requesting data from a web server. Whilst being connected to the internet, data is being sent and received from your device to the server all the time. 

In a network itself it is the router that will direct the web traffic as well as the data to the correct destinations. Due to the fact that data is being constantly sent and received, very is always going to be a risk of an attack taking place. An attack can take place whilst the data is in the process of being sent to your machine or it can even be sent within the data itself. Because of this, there are security measures in place like firewalls which are used on most machines connected to the internet. These firewalls keep us safe by blocking specific types of data from passing through its filter. Because of this extra level of security, the time it takes for the data to be received can take longer as it needs to be screened before is can continue its journey. If the data passes the screening then it will be allowed through however if not, it is sent back to the sender. There are occasions where data is falsely identified to be harmful which results in the data not being sent however this is a really rare occurrence.

---

## Glossary of Operating Principles:
### Networking devices:
#### Hubs
Hubs server as a connection point for a network. Hubs manage and route traffic over the local connections. Data is sent one piece at a time, so all users don’t get a copy, this slows the system down.
#### Routers
Routers are devices that connect multiple local networks. Data is sent through packets to the router with an address attached. The router will then send the data packet to the address which is attached. The router then works out the best route and sends it. 
#### Switches
A switch is similar to a hub. A switch takes and routes data to machines that are connected through a LAN. The difference is that every machine connected to the switch will receive a copy of the data sent. This speeds up the LAN but can have security issues.
#### Multilayer switch
A multilayer switch is similar to a normal switch however is operates more efficiently. This multilayer switch can increase the speed of data being transferred.
#### Firewall
A firewall is a piece of software or even a piece of hardware that sorts the data that passes through it. A firewall will open and close ports in order to stop specific types of data from passing through.
#### HIDS
HIDS stands for host-based intrusion detection system. It is used to detect threats to a network by searching through the data being sent through the network. It looks for abnormalities that could be seen as a threat. 
#### Repeaters
Repeaters are devices that are used to help strengthen a signal that is being sent over a large distance on a physical LAN. Repeaters allow for the size of LANs to be much larger than if not used.
#### Bridges
A bridge is used to get a connection with another network using a bridge. The only constraint of a bridge is that both bridges need to be using the same protocols. The reason for this is because bridges use an internal database to determine what traffic is allowed in and out of the network.
### Wireless devices
#### Access point (wireless/wired)
Access points are used to help provide users with a connection to a network while they are physically not connected to that network. The most common form of access points are wireless as they use Wi-Fi to allow users to connect to the network instantly.
#### Content filter
Content filters are used to help screen the incoming data against a set of rules and if it does not meet the requirements then it won’t be allowed through. Some common filters check for spam or malicious files.
#### Load balancer
A load balancer is used to help spread the workload over an entire network. The load balancer does this by preventing certain pathways and connections on a network becoming busy and affect the speed of the network.
#### Modem 
A modem is used to connect networks via an existing telephone line. This can be convenient when reaching remote areas, it has a drawback where there are limited speeds through these connections.
#### Packet shaper 
Packet shapers are used to help prioritise specific data that is sent over a network. This forces lower priority packets such as instant messages to wait to be sent whilst more important data is sent.
#### VPN concentrator
A VPN concentrator is used to help allow multiple users on the same network to use the same VPN. It is able to do this by coordinating and organising traffic on a network between different machines trying to access the VPN.
### Server types:
#### Web
A web server is a type of server which sends and stores data on websites over the internet. Users will request information from the web server on how to display the webpage as well as what information is also needed to be loaded. The server will respond and send a copy of the data to the user.
#### File
A file server is simply a server where its main purpose is to store data and files. The data on these servers can vary depending on who owns the server however as long as the user has access then the data can be sent to them.
#### Database
A database server is a form of server that stores data in certain categories or fields. The server will store the information and it will all be related to one another. A way of seeing how this server works could be looking at it like a store. If you scan an item on a system, it will bring up all of the information related to that item.
#### Combination (e.g MS Small Business Servers)
A combination server is a server that will merge all of the previous three servers into one. It will perform all of the previous tasks as well all on one system/server.
#### Virtual server 
A virtualized server is a server that can have the functionality of a physical server however it is nothing more than a small machine loaded with specialised software. This software helps the virtual server to perform the tasks needed by a server.
#### terminal services server
A terminal services server is a device that provides other computers connected to this device with a path to another LAN or WAN. The computers themselves don’t need to be connected to a router or a switch to make the connection.

## Workstation hardware and software
### Network software
#### Client software
Client software is software that works within LANs and WANs. They act as an interface between the client’s computer and the server on the network. This software is located on the clients PC. This software can be any application that it is installed on the clients PC. 
#### Server software
Server software is the software that a server in a network uses. The server software will provide the server with the correct functions and abilities that it needs to be able to connect correctly with any devices connected on that network.
#### Client operating system
Client operating system works within the client’s computer. This piece of software is a low-level software that supports the computers basic function and abilities. The operating system helps users by giving them a physical GUI to help them Perform simple tasks and functions. There are a few common operating systems; Windows, Mac OS and LINUX.
#### Server operating system
Server operating system is similar to a clients operating system however it is specially designed for the server’s primary functions and tasks. The main functions that a server has to deal with could consist of anything from communicating with devices connect too managing databases, web mail and file management.
#### Firewall
The firewall within a server is used to help filter traffic travelling through the network. The firewall will filter out malicious packets of data by closing specific ports. The firewall adds a security benefit to any network as it is reducing the chance of harmful data being received on any of the devices.
#### Proxies
Proxies are servers which run on a computer that acts as a halfway point between a server and the end destination. These proxies will receive requests from the client to access an internet resource. A proxies job is to act as a gate between an endpoint and another server that the user is trying to connect too.
### Comparison of network and cabling
#### Network comparison
A network card is a piece of hardware that allows a computer to connect to a network. This card will allow the computer to exchange data and information between the network and the computer of which its installed. This device is very helpful when trying to connect to a network. An alternative way to connect the computer to the network could be through wireless connection. The wireless network would connect to the computer or any device without the need for physical cabling. This means that the network could be accessed as long as the device is connected to the internet. The third type of connection is mobile. Mobile or cellular is where a mobile network is distributed through the use of cell towers. These cell towers have fixed transceivers or a base station to allow the user to connect.
#### Cabling
Cabling is what connects devices or hardware to enable them to transmit data from device to device. Cabling is the most efficient way of connection computers together. Cabling is only really used if the physical distance between the two machines is small enough. When compared to wireless connections, wired has a huge advantage when it comes to data travelling speeds. Some examples of physical cables are:
##### Patch Cables:
Patch cables are cables which are used to connect home networks and business networks as their length can be limiting. They are most commonly used to connect devices to hubs, switches and routers within a network.
##### Shielded Cables:
Shielded cables are ethernet cables which have an additional layer of insulation with a conductive layer inside. This type of cabling helps to reduce the electricity on the outside of the cable which in turn helps with the reduction in the loss of packets whilst traveling through this cable.
##### Twisted Pair
A twisted pair cable is a cable which has two copper cables twisted around one another within the same wire. This form of cabling helps to reduce against signal jumping across different cables whilst packets of data are being sent or received.
#### Permissions
Permissions are the privileges that come with different clients and devices on a network. For instance a client may not have the same permissions as an admin on a network as they wont be required to use the same abilities or options. There are different types of permissions that are allowed on a network. There are two types of permissions on a network;
##### NTFS
NTFS are permissions that set what users can have access to specific files or folders held on a network. These permissions can set who has access to read and who also has access to edit files. TFS allows for more flexible options as it has a wider range to give users the right permissions that they will need to maintain the network as well as the files stored on it.
##### Shared permissions
Shared permissions allow for a similar approach to NTFS however, these privileges are set for certain shared files. The permissions of the files stored will vary depending on the user that is trying to access them. For instance one user may only be able to read the file however another user with higher up permissions may be able to edit the file. 
#### Workstation
Workstation computers are special computers that have specialist components built inside that allow them to perform certain tasks much better than traditional computers. Usually a workstation computer will have a much higher grade CPU, this CPU may have double the amount of cores so that some tasks can be spread over these new cores. Another main component is the amount of RAM that is used. Workstation computers these days can have up to 256GB of RAM which for simple everyday task is overkill however these workstation computers may need it to help with specialist tasks.
#### System Bus
A system bus is a series of internal connections that connect all of the individual components of a computer as well as allowing them to communicate with one another. These connections are very small however they are essential to the computers components working together. If there was not a system BUS then components like the CPU would not be able to get instructions sent to other components like RAM and the GPU. The address of the BUS will determine where the information of instructions will be sent too. Th control BUS is used to help determine its operating when the instructions get there.

## Network design
### Testing and evaluation of design:
We were given the task of creating two LANs, both with a star topology. Both networks would connect via a router on either side. Each network had 3 pc’s, one server, one router, one switch, one printer and one access point. Once each of the networks had been created needed to connect them so that we can send packets of data between the two networks. The design below shows just how we met the requirements for the project as well as how the final product is going to roughly be laid out:

![network design 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/40590183-814781fe-61f2-11e8-8fa3-4d5629f2a2db.png)

The requirements that we were given were:
* Have two different local networks
* Be able to add more PCs if needed
* Be able communicate between the two networks
* See that the network is laid out as a star network
* Be able to add additional devices

The requirements are very simple to break down;
1.	Have two different local networks – Each network needed to have 3 pc’s at least as well as a server. These main four pieces of hardware needed to connect to the switch for the network which would then connect to the router. Once all of our devices were connected correctly we would then be able to connect both routers from both networks with a straight-through cable.

2.	Be able to add more PCs if needed – We were able to achieve this by setting up the servers DHCP settings so that it would automatically allocate an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and a DNS server address to each new system. Also, the switch was chosen so that it could be easily expanded by adding additional access ports.

3.	Be able to communicate between the two networks – This was achieved by firstly setting up the routers to talk to one another. However, we also set up the DNS in each of the servers of both network so that each pc could be given a name and you could ping to either its name or IP address from another pc on either network. Both routers are connected through a serial DTE cable. Once everything was set up we would ping PCs from each network to make sure the packets travelled successfully.

4.	See that the network is laid out as a star network – A star network topology is where there is a central device and the other devices all connect to that one device to communicate with one another. For our networks we had the switches at the centre.

5.	Be able to add additional devices – for this last requirement, it was more of an extension. However, it was very simple to do as we had previously set up the server on each network with its DHCP and DNS settings. Therefore, it was just a simple task of connecting the devices which we chose a printer and an access port. Once they were connected all we needed to do was to add the gateway IP address and the DNS server IP address and they were ready for use.

#### Evaluation of design:
Overall, I feel as though the initial design is very good. I feel as though it has covered all of the requirements of the user very well and is laid out in a professional manner. In theory if each piece of hardware on each network is set up correctly, it will work perfectly. The design allows for DHCP settings to be added in the server as well as a DNS setting in the server also. This will help new devices to be automatically allocated all the required information to run on the network. The design has met all of the requirements set by the user and will work if there is no human error so therefore I can conclude that it is a successful design.

### Configuration of network
Both networks had specific requirements that needed to be included. These were the IP addresses allocated to each pc, the server and the router of both networks. Below you can see the IP addresses given:
#### Network 1
PC1 – 192.168.1.100

PC2 – 192.168.1.101

PC3 – 192.168.1.102

Server – 192.168.1.10

Router – 192.168.1.1

#### Network 2
PC1 – 192.168.10.100

PC2 – 192.168.10.101

PC3 – 192.168.10.102

Server – 192.168.10.10

Router – 192.168.10.1

### Creating the network
The image below is of the finished network which has been completed to the specifications of the user. As you can also see, it follows a close design to my earlier concept design. Whilst creating this network I basically followed my initial plan that I has come up with during the design stage. I stuck to my design and added in all of the devices that were on the design. In addition to following the design I also made both networks more unique by giving them a different naming theme. For Network 1 I used a Simpsons theme where I named all of the PCs after characters and called the overall network Springfield. For Network 2 I used the theme of Family Guy. I also names the PCs after characters and the overall network Quahog.

### Testing
In order to make sure that my designed networks work correctly as intended I have created a test plan to go through some of the important features. The test plan also tested each of the user requirements given to me. The test plan itself shows the action, the expected result as well as the actual result. There is also another section where if there is any problems or actions required, I can make a not to say what needs to be done to fix it. Obviously, I wanted each tests outcome to be its expected outcome so that it proves that the design and implementation was a success.
