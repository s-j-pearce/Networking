# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

### Peer-based
The purpose of a peer-based or p2p network is to allow users to connect with each other directly. By having multiple pc's that connect through this method it eliminates the need for a dedicated server. Using this method allows each pc to function as a client as well as a server.

The main benefit of a peer based network is that there is no single provider being responsible for a server. Each computer stores files and acts as a server. Each computer has its own equal responsibility for providing data. In the peer-to-peer model, many users on the network could store a file. Each computer can then send sections of the file, sharing the workload. Each client can download and share files with other users. A p2p would not be an ideal network if a company was looking to provide a service like selling tickets as one main server would need to keep track of how many tickets are left. Also on P2P networks, no single computer is responsible for storing a file - anyone can delete files as they wish meaning that it is certainly not ideal for commercial use.

Peer-based networks are fairly easy to set up and understand. within this model any computer can be used and connected to another through a hub or switch. The hub or switch will only be there to connect the pc's together. This allows all the computers to communicated without the need for special hardware or software. This method also allows the network to be easily maintained internally as there is no need for an external network manager. 

Due to the design of this method, it does have some drawbacks. Each computer has a greater load using this method as they are all doing not only their tasks but they are also taking on the tasks that a server would have. Each computer will also need to have its own antivirus and protection software as there isn’t a server in place to stop unwanted traffic. If a virus was to gain access or get onto one machine, then it can easily gain access to the others on the network.

### Client-server
#### purpose
The purpose of a client server is to serve the end users. These end users are called clients. The clients would use this server method in order to gain access to resources like files, songs, videos or many other services that can be stored on a system known as a server. 
#### benefits
The main benefits of a client-server network are; All the files are stored in a central location which can be accessed by all pc’s on that network. All of the network peripherals are controlled centrally. This method means that back-ups and security for the network is all controlled from a central location. Users are able to access shared files and data from a central location(the server).
#### resource implications
Resource implication is fairly simple as files and data are stored in a central location on a server. All the pc’s on that network are able to access them as long as the users on those pc’s have been given permissions too. Data and files being stored from the central location means that it is quicker for users to access them and use them. The only real constraint of this method could be internet connection, e.g. if someone has low internet speeds, they may have to wait longer for a file that someone who has fast internet speeds. 
#### communications
Pc’s on this network method will send requests to the central server and it will respond by fulfilling a request. For example, an end user or client may ask to open a public document or file which is stored on the server, the server will then respond by checking the end users credentials to make sure they have the right ones to access that file. Once that process is finished it will then open up the file for the user on that system. As clients connect with the server through the internet, the client’s internet speeds will determine how quickly the file or resource is downloaded to their system/pc.
#### working practice
This method is one of the most common for working practices. The reason for this is so that clients are able to access files and information that is required for their job but need to be shared and available for multiple people. This method includes internet so one of the more common ways that this is used would be for colleges or university’s where the students need to access files or lectures.
#### commercial opportunity
This method can be used for commercial use as companies could allow clients or users to access specific files or data from outside the business. A lot of commerce companies use this network method as it means that a lot of people can access the same piece of data at one time, this is something that is very important for a business which deals with sales.
#### information sharing
Information sharing is a fairly simple process through this method as this method allows users to receive and send data to the server through the internet. This means that if the server has been set up correctly users can upload information and files for others to use and see. This method also allows users to make what they upload private or public.
